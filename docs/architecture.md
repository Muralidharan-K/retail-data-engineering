# Retail Data Engineering & Analytics Platform

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end retail data engineering and analytics
platform using multiple enterprise and cloud technologies.

The platform demonstrates:

- Batch data ingestion
- ETL and ELT
- Data quality and validation
- Incremental processing
- Change data capture concepts
- Data transformation
- Data warehouse dimensional modeling
- Workflow orchestration
- CI/CD
- Containerization
- Cloud storage and messaging
- Business intelligence

---

## 2. Business Scenario

The project represents a retail organization operating multiple stores and
an online sales channel.

The business generates data related to:

- Customers
- Products
- Stores
- Orders
- Order items
- Payments

Data originates from both legacy databases and cloud file sources.

The objective is to consolidate the data into Snowflake and provide trusted
analytics datasets for business reporting.

---

## 3. Source Systems

### Oracle

Oracle represents the organization's legacy transactional database.

Example data:

- Customers
- Products
- Stores
- Historical orders

Oracle data will be extracted using Informatica.

### AWS S3

S3 represents cloud-based file data received from external systems.

Example files:

- Daily sales
- Order updates
- Product updates
- Customer updates

---

# RAW

Contains data loaded from source systems with minimal transformation.

# STAGING

Performs standardization, type conversion, cleansing and basic validation.

# CORE

Contains integrated business entities and reusable business logic.

# ANALYTICS / MART

Contains reporting-ready dimensional models.

# Dimensional Model

   FACT_SALES

FACT_SALES will contain measurable business events such as sales quantity,
sales amount, discount and payment amount.

# Containerization

Docker will be used to containerize development and orchestration components.
Example:
    Docker
        ├── Airflow
        ├── PostgreSQL metadata database
        └── Supporting services
# Messaging
AWS SQS will be used to demonstrate queue-based event processing.

AWS SNS will be used for notification and publish/subscribe scenarios.

# Project Goal

The final solution should demonstrate an end-to-end production-style data
engineering workflow rather than isolated technology exercises.

The same retail business scenario and datasets will be used throughout the
project.
